## Building a Modern Computer From First Principles

These are my solutions to the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
course. The course was a great experience and gave me a much greater
appreciation of how a computer works under the hood.

I initially struggled with the design of some of the more advanced circuits,
but following the guide and the hints provided provided very helpful.

I hope to come back to this course and complete the final set of Projects.
